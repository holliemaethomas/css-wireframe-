        <p>They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so.It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako.

            See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. Here's something that's fun.
            
            No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. All kinds of happy little splashes. Working it up and down, back and forth. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be.
            
            If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. Let's have a nice tree right here.
            
            You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Let your imagination be your guide. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes.
            
            You need the dark in order to show the light. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. Don't be bashful drop me a line.</p>
